# Mern book Engine application.

## This application will be executing the Full Stack MERN architecture and this sites functionality will give the user the ability to search any book from googles Library Api.

## This applications live web service is displayed on render using MongoDB

## render link: https://gb-search-qd1i.onrender.com/

I was motivated to create this application having trouble Searching books online and didn't want to use a library with a larger database such as google.

I wanted to create this application so that Any User, can search for any books on our application
and recieve the book or related books when the user searches for it. and save the books on their account so they can have a reminder of what book to look into.

* This application Provides a large database of books that the user can search for any book within the google database, this solves the problem of other sites having limited selection of books

* Every search will provide 10 results related to the search, this solves the restrictions other sites have when searching for books.

* An account can be made, and the user will gain the ability to bookmark the books they want to save, and it solves the quick reminder that other applications dont provide.

## I learned throughout this application, how to deploy on render and to connect the MONGODB. I Learned Apollo and the connectivity and related uses of queries and mutations using the Apollo Query Server.

## I learned the MERN full-stack application architecture that is industry standard for mordern applications.

This application stands out from my other applications as it sets-up a great new way to create, develop, and deploy my full-stack application from now on into the future.
